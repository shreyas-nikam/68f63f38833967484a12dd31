In this lab, we will explore the AI-Readiness Score (AI-R) framework, a parametric model designed to quantify an individual's preparedness for AI-enabled careers. The AI-R score helps in navigating career transitions by considering both individual capabilities and market opportunities.

The core formula for the AI-Readiness Score for an individual $i$ at time $t$ is defined as:
""")
st.latex(r""" AI-R_{i,t} = \alpha \cdot V^R_i(t) + (1-\alpha) \cdot H^R_i(t) + \beta \cdot \text{Synergy}\%(V^R, H^R) """)
st.markdown("""
Where:
-   $V^R(t)$ is the Idiosyncratic Readiness (individual capability).
-   $H^R(t)$ is the Systematic Opportunity (market demand).
-   $\\alpha \in [0,1]$ is the weight on individual vs. market factors.
-   $\\beta > 0$ is the Synergy coefficient.
-   Both $V^R$ and $H^R$ are normalized to $[0, 100]$.
-   $\text{Synergy}\%$ is also normalized to $[0, 100]$ percentage units.

This framework allows for dynamic "what-if" scenario planning, enabling users to understand how different learning pathways and career transitions impact their future career prospects.
