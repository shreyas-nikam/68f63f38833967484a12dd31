This Streamlit application is a lab project designed to demonstrate the **AI-Readiness Score (AI-R)** framework. It serves as an interactive tool for individuals to assess their preparedness for careers in the age of AI and to explore potential upskilling pathways. The application quantifies an individual's readiness by considering personal capabilities, market opportunities, and the synergy between them.

## üìñ Project Description

The AI Career Navigator is built around the AI-Readiness Score (AI-R), a parametric model designed to quantify an individual's preparedness for AI-enabled careers. This score helps in navigating career transitions by considering both individual capabilities and market opportunities.

The core formula for the AI-Readiness Score for an individual $i$ at time $t$ is defined as:

$$ AI-R_{i,t} = \alpha \cdot V^R_i(t) + (1-\alpha) \cdot H^R_i(t) + \beta \cdot \text{Synergy}\%(V^R, H^R) $$

Where:
-   $V^R(t)$ is the **Idiosyncratic Readiness** (individual capability).
-   $H^R(t)$ is the **Systematic Opportunity** (market demand).
-   $\alpha \in [0,1]$ is the weight on individual vs. market factors.
-   $\beta > 0$ is the Synergy coefficient.

This framework allows for dynamic "what-if" scenario planning, enabling users to understand how different learning pathways and career transitions impact their future career prospects.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **AI-Readiness Score Calculation**: A detailed, multi-input form to calculate a personalized AI-R score based on:
    -   **Idiosyncratic Readiness ($V^R$)**: Assesses individual skills through `AI-Fluency`, `Domain-Expertise`, and `Adaptive-Capacity`.
    -   **Systematic Opportunity ($H^R$)**: Evaluates market demand for a chosen target occupation.
    -   **Synergy**: Measures the alignment between an individual's skills and market requirements.
-   **Pathway Simulation**: A "what-if" analysis tool to simulate the impact of completing specific learning pathways on the user's AI-R score.
-   **Data Explorer**: Provides transparency by allowing users to view the underlying (synthetic) datasets for occupations, skills, and learning pathways.
-   **Interactive Visualizations**: Uses Plotly to generate dynamic pie and bar charts for an intuitive breakdown of score components.
-   **Customizable Parameters**: Allows real-time adjustment of key model parameters ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) via sidebar sliders.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3.8+ and `pip` installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-career-navigator.git
    cd ai-career-navigator
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    -   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    -   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    A `requirements.txt` file is needed to list the project's dependencies. Create one with the following content:
    ```txt
    # requirements.txt
    streamlit
    pandas
    numpy
    plotly
    ```
    Then, run the installation command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üíª Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your web browser will automatically open to the application's local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

### How to Use the App:

1.  **Adjust Global Parameters**: Use the sliders in the left sidebar to set the global $\alpha$ (weight on individual factors) and $\beta$ (synergy coefficient) parameters.
2.  **Calculate Your Score**:
    -   Navigate to the **"AI-Readiness Score"** page.
    -   Fill in your personal and professional details in the three expandable input sections: `Idiosyncratic Readiness`, `Systematic Opportunity`, and `Synergy`.
    -   Click the **"Calculate AI-Readiness Score"** button.
    -   Review your scores and the component breakdown charts in the "Results" section.
3.  **Simulate Pathways**:
    -   Navigate to the **"Pathway Simulation"** page.
    -   Select a learning pathway from the dropdown menu and adjust the completion/mastery scores.
    -   Click **"Simulate Pathway Impact"** to see a comparison of your current vs. projected scores.
4.  **Explore Data**:
    -   Go to the **"Data Explorer"** page to view the synthetic data tables that power the application's calculations.
